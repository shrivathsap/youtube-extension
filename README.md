# youtube-extension
Are there channels whose content you do not wish to see? Do you wish to limit your YouTube usage? Well, fear not, for here is an extension that does what you want! For the low price of $0.00, you too can control what you watch, and when.

How it works:
Basically download these files, and in your chromium based browser add the extension. In yt.js, there's an array where you can put some default channels that you want to avoid so that that list remains same even if you clear localStorage. Load the extension in your chromium browser and an alert should pop up the first time.
While on youtube.com, you can view the blacklisted channels in console with Shift+V, you can remove a blacklisted channel with Shift+R (this will prompt you to enter the channel (case sensitive, obviously) and you can add a channel you are currently watching with Shift+A.
Moreover, if you want to use YouTube only during certain times of the day, well there's a function for that as well.
Why bother? Well, basically I wanted to not consume content from certain channels, so the best thing was to find a way to not see those channels in my feed - out of sight, out of mind. And I want this even if I am not signed in or in other such situations.
